## DCBug

There are six folders including our artifact, original data, and experiemnt results.

*   RQ0-artifact: Our artifact is released in this folder including ArchDiff, ArchPatternFinder, and Metric measurement suite.
    *  The artifact:ArchDiff is in sub-folder: 'ArchDiff'. 
    *  Artifacts: ArchPatternFinder and metric measurement suite, are together in sub-folder: 'ArchBugStudy'.  
*   RQ0-dataset: Our dataset used is released in this folder including bug reports, bug fixes and revision history.  
    * Bug reports studied are in zip file: 'bug-report-record.zip'. In addition, short summaries for these reports are in sub-folder: 'bug-report-index'.
    * Bug fixes used are in sub-folder: 'bug-fix-record'. 
    * Records of revision history used are in sub-folder: 'revision-history-record'.   
*   RQ1-proportion: data used in RQ1: the proportion of arch bugs and fixes, is released in this folder including records of arch fixes, distribution of arch bugs, and features of arch bugs. 
    *   Record of arch fixes are in zip file: 'arch-fix-commit.zip'. 
    *   Data about distribution of arch bugs are in sub-folder: 'arch-bug'. 
    *   Data about dependency features of arch bugs are in sub-folder: 'arch-type'.
*   RQ2-characteristic: Data used in RQ2: the characteristic of arch bugs, is released in this folder including fixing lines of code (LOC) and the bug transition (fixing time and reopening).
    *   Data about fixing lines of code (LOC) is in sub-folder: 'bug-loc'.  
    *   Data about bug transition data is in sub-folder: 'bug-transition'.  
    *   Data about other characteristics can be derived directly from originial records in '*RQ0-dataset'.
*   RQ3-pattern: Data used in RQ3: is released in this folder containing 7 sub-folders: 'arch-fix', 'bug-file', 'all-dep', 'arch-bug-dep', 'bug-dep', 'pattern-instance', and 'pattern-file'. For selected subjects in RQ3:
    *   Records about arch fixes are in sub-folder: 'arch-fix'.  
    *   Data about file bug-proneness is in sub-folder: 'bug-file'.
    *   Data about all dependencies is in sub-folder: 'all-dep'.
    *   Data about dependencies in arch bugs is in sub-folder: 'arch-bug-dep'.
    *   Data about dependencies among bug-prone files is in sub-folder: 'bug-dep'.
    *   Data about deteted patterns is in sub-folder: 'pattern-instance'
    *   Data about file in detected patterns is in sub-folder: 'pattern-file'.  
*Data-Summary: Part of our originial data and experiemnt results is released in this folder.

We have released our artifact used, dataset used and part of our experiment data. Thanks for your review. Thanks for your attention.
